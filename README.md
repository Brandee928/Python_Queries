# Python_Queries

CareerFoundry python projects based on "customer" Instacart's data.

## Stakeholders Questions
1) What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?
2) Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
3) Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
4) Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering
habits?
5) What different classifications does the demographic information suggest?
Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
6) What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer
profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.
